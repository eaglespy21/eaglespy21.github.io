            <img src="dp_resized.png">
            <p>Welcome to my website! I specialize in designing and implementing highly efficient, flexible,
                and robust back-end software infrastructure, complemented by a solid understanding of front-end development.
                My journey began in college with a passion for crafting a personal assistant capable of intuitive assistance
                without explicit prompts.
                Over the years, I've diversified my expertise, delving into various realms such as distributed systems, embedded systems,
                Single Page Applications (SPAs),
                stock market prediction algorithms, wearable technology, and most recently,
                Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications.
