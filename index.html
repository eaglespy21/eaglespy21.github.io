            <p>Welcome to my website! I specialize in designing and implementing highly efficient, flexible,
                and robust back-end software infrastructure, complemented by a solid understanding of front-end development.
                My journey began in college with a passion for crafting a personal assistant capable of intuitive assistance
                without explicit prompts.</p>
                Over the years, I've diversified my expertise, delving into various realms such as distributed systems, embedded systems,
                Single Page Applications (SPAs),
                stock market prediction algorithms, wearable technology, and most recently,
                Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications.

            <h2>Software Engineer at KLA: Artificial Intelligence Group</h2>
            <h3>Jan 2020 to present</h3>
            <p>
                At KLA I am part of the team that develops and integrates AI solutions for the
                inspection suite of products. I am responsible for building generic infrastructure code that
                handles different data formats, optimizes training & inference performance, visualizes
                results, and facilitates prototyping. With the objective of reducing the time to market of
                these solutions by mitigating risks and proving value. My role also comprises evaluating
                the latest features released in AI and Data Science related technologies listed under the

            <h2>Software Engineer at KLA: Broadband Plasma Group</h2>
            <h3>August 2017 to January 2020</h3>
            <p>
                I learned how to write and wrote enterprise software for motion hardware, system design,
                and control. I learned about the product lifecycle and the different stages from design to
                implementation and maintenance. Being in the software team that pulled all the hardware
                pieces together I learned the importance of working as a team. Even though I enjoyed the
                work, it was not challenging enough, and I still had a burning desire to work on AI. I moved
                to the AI group in 2020.
